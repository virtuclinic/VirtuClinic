very short-term ailments and can spread easily. There are many types of viruses that can cause one to have a common cold. 

</p></h3><h4> <em> How does it spread? </em> </h4> 
<p>
It can spread by <em>airborne respiratory droplets</em> (which is by coughing or sneezing), by <em>saliva</em>,
by <em>skin-to-skin contact</em> and by <em>touching a contaminated surface</em>.

</p>

<h3> <strong> Information on Treatments! </strong> </h3>
<p> Most people, within two weeks, can recover on their own. 

One <em>soothing remedy</em> is to apply menthol to the affected area (for example, you could
use Vicks VapoRub). 

A <em> pain reliever </em> that one could use to treat their common cold is <em> acetaminophen
</em>, or Tylenol. Some other treatments include Mucinex, Delsym, and Zicam. You can also 
use a throat lozenge to sooth your throat. Two other methods to assuage your symptoms are
cough medicine and nasal irrigation.
